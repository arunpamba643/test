    "# CONTEXTUAL RETRIEVAL WITH LLAMA_INDEX\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers contextual retrieval with llama_index DocumentContextExtractor\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on an Anthropic [blost post](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval), the concept is to:\n",
    "1. Use an LLM to generate a 'context' for each chunk based on the entire document\n",
    "2. embed the chunk + context together\n",
    "3. reap the benefits of higher RAG accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can also do this manually, the DocumentContextExtractor offers a lot of convenience and error handling, plus you can integrate it into your llama_index pipelines! Let's get started."

      "Reddit got two more people from their YC batch: Chris Slowe and Aaron Swartz, and they too were unusually smart. Chris was just finishing his PhD in physics at Harvard. Aaron was younger, a college freshman, and even more anti-authority than Steve. It's not exaggerating to describe him as a martyr for what authority later did to him.\n",

      "Slowly but inexorably Reddit's traffic grew. At first the numbers were so small they were hard to distinguish from background noise. But within a few weeks it was clear that there was a core of real users returning regularly to the site. And although all kinds of things have happened to Reddit the company in the years since, Reddit the site never looked back.\n",

      "Reddit the site (and now app) is such a fundamentally useful thing that it's almost unkillable. Which is why, despite a long stretch after Steve left when the management strategy ranged from benign neglect to spectacular blunders, traffic just kept growing. You can't do that with most companies. Most companies you take your eye off the ball for six months and you're in deep trouble. But Reddit was special, and when Steve came back in 2015, I knew the world was in for a surprise.\n",

      "People thought they had Reddit's number: one of the players in Silicon Valley, but not one of the big ones. But those who knew what had been going on behind the scenes knew there was more to the story than this. If Reddit could grow to the size it had with management that was harmless at best, what could it do if Steve came back? We now know the answer to that question. Or at least a lower bound on the answer. Steve is not out of ideas yet.\n"
