    "# Structured LLM Reranker Demonstration (2021 Lyft 10-k)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showcases how to do a two-stage pass for retrieval. Use embedding-based retrieval with a high top-k value\n",
    "in order to maximize recall and get a large set of candidate items. Then, use LLM-based retrieval\n",
    "to dynamically select the nodes that are actually relevant to the query using structured output.\n",

    "Usage of `StructuredLLMReranker` is preferred over `LLMReranker` when you are using a model that supports function calling.\n",
    "This class will make use of the structured output capability of the model instead of relying on prompting the model to rank the nodes in a desired format."
