This agent performs a web search to find relevant resources for a research topic, interacts with them, and extracts key metadata (e.g., title, author, publication details, and abstract) from those resources."

It found that stress did not negatively impact exercise participation among habitually active adults with such equipment. The study suggests that habitual exercise may buffer the impact of stress on regular moderate to vigorous activity, and highlights the potential role of home-based internet-connected exercise equipment in this buffering.\n",
