Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed with native mobile emulation. The Playwright library can be used as a general purpose browser automation tool, providing a powerful set of APIs to automate web applications, for both sync and async Python. This introduction describes the Playwright Pytest plugin, which is the recommended way to write end-to-end tests. You will learn How to install Playwright Pytest How to run the example test Installing Playwright Pytest ​ Playwright recommends using the official Playwright Pytest plugin to write end-to-end tests. It provides context isolation, running it on multiple browser configurations out of the box. Get started by installing Playwright and running the example test to see it in action. PyPI Anaconda Install the Pytest plugin : pip install pytest-playwright Install the Pytest plugin : conda config --add channels conda-forge conda config --add channels microsoft conda install pytest-playwright Install the required browsers: playwright install Add Example Test ​ Create a file that follows the test_ prefix convention, such as test_example.py , inside the current working directory or in a sub-directory with the code below. Make sure your test name also follows the test_ prefix convention. test_example.py import re from playwright . sync_api import Page , expect def test_has_title ( page : Page ) : page . goto ( \"https://playwright.dev/\" ) # Expect a title \"to contain\" a substring. expect ( page ) . to_have_title ( re . compile ( \"Playwright\" ) ) def test_get_started_link ( page : Page ) : page . goto ( \"https://playwright.dev/\" ) # Click the get started link. page . get_by_role ( \"link\" , name = \"Get started\" ) . click ( ) # Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation. expect ( page . get_by_role ( \"heading\" , name = \"Installation\" ) ) . to_be_visible ( ) Running the Example Test ​ By default tests will be run on chromium. This can be configured via the CLI options . Tests are run in headless mode meaning no browser UI will open up when running the tests. Results of the tests and test logs will be shown in the terminal. pytest Updating Playwright ​ To update Playwright to the latest version run the following command: pip install pytest-playwright playwright -U System requirements ​ Python 3.8 or higher. Windows 10+, Windows Server 2016+ or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). macOS 13 Ventura, or later. Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04, on x86-64 and arm64 architecture. What's next ​ Write tests using web first assertions, page fixtures and locators Run single test, multiple tests, headed mode Generate tests with Codegen See a trace of your tests Next Writing tests Introduction Installing Playwright Pytest Add Example Test Running the Example Test Updating Playwright System requirements What's next Learn Getting started Playwright Training Learn Videos Feature Videos Community Stack Overflow Discord Twitter LinkedIn More GitHub YouTube Blog Ambassadors Copyright © 2025 Microsoft\n"

      "Sam Altman's blog post on productivity offers a comprehensive guide to enhancing personal efficiency and effectiveness. Here are the key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Compound Growth**: Altman emphasizes the importance of small productivity gains compounded over time, likening it to financial growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Choosing the Right Work**: The most crucial aspect of productivity is selecting the right tasks. Independent thought and strong personal beliefs are vital.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Delegation and Enjoyment**: Delegate tasks based on others' strengths and interests. Avoid work that doesn't interest you, as it hampers morale and productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Learning and Collaboration**: Embrace the ability to learn quickly and surround yourself with inspiring, positive people.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Prioritization**: Altman uses lists to manage tasks and prioritizes work that builds momentum. He stresses the importance of saying no to non-critical tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Time Management**: Avoid unnecessary meetings and optimize your schedule for productivity, leaving room for serendipitous encounters.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Physical Well-being**: Sleep, exercise, and nutrition are critical. Altman shares his personal routines, including sleep optimization, exercise, and dietary habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Workspace and Tools**: A conducive workspace and efficient tools, like custom software and fast typing skills, enhance productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Overcommitment**: A slight overcommitment can boost efficiency, but excessive overcommitment is detrimental.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Direction Matters**: Productivity is meaningless if directed towards the wrong goals. Focus on what truly matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Altman concludes by emphasizing the importance of balancing productivity with personal happiness and relationships.\n"

Compound\\ngrowth gets discussed as a financial concept, but it works in careers as well,\\nand it is magic.\\xa0 A small productivity\\ngain, compounded over 50 years, is worth a lot.\\xa0\\nSo it’s worth figuring out how to optimize productivity. If you get 10%\\nmore done and 1% better every day compared to someone else, the compounded\\ndifference is massive. What you work on It doesn’t\\nmatter how fast you move if it’s in a worthless direction.\\xa0 Picking the right thing to work on is the\\nmost important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.\\xa0 So think about it more!\\xa0 Independent thought is hard but it’s\\nsomething you can get better at with practice. The most\\nimpressive people I know have strong beliefs about the world, which is rare in\\nthe general population. \\xa0If you find yourself always agreeing with whomever\\nyou last spoke with, that’s bad.\\xa0 You\\nwill of course be wrong sometimes, but develop the confidence to stick with\\nyour convictions.\\xa0 It will let you be\\ncourageous when you’re right about something important that most people don’t\\nsee. I make sure to\\nleave enough time in my schedule to think about what to work on. \\xa0The best\\nways for me to do this are reading books, hanging out with interesting people,\\nand spending time in nature. I’ve learned\\nthat I can’t be very productive working on things I don’t care about or don’t\\nlike. \\xa0So I just try not to put myself in a position where I have to do\\nthem (by delegating, avoiding, or something else). \\xa0Stuff that you don’t\\nlike is a painful drag on morale and momentum. By the way,\\nhere is an important lesson about delegation: remember that everyone else is also\\nmost productive when they’re doing what they like, and do what you’d want other\\npeople to do for you—try to figure out who likes (and is good at) doing what,\\nand delegate that way. If you find\\nyourself not liking what you’re doing for a long period of time, seriously\\nconsider a major job change. \\xa0Short-term burnout happens, but if it isn’t\\nresolved with some time off, maybe it’s time to do something you’re more\\ninterested in. I’ve been very\\nfortunate to find work I like so much I’d do it for free, which makes it easy\\nto be really productive. It’s important\\nto learn that you can learn anything you want, and that you can get better\\nquickly. \\xa0This feels like an unlikely miracle the first few times it\\nhappens, but eventually you learn to trust that you can do it. Doing great\\nwork usually requires colleagues of some sort. \\xa0Try to be around smart,\\nproductive, happy, and positive people that don’t belittle your ambitions.\\xa0 I love being around people who push me and\\ninspire me to be better.\\xa0 To the degree\\nyou able to, avoid the opposite kind of people—the cost of letting them take up\\nyour mental cycles is horrific. You have to\\nboth pick the right problem and do the work. \\xa0There aren’t many\\nshortcuts.\\xa0 If you’re going to do\\nsomething really important, you are very likely going to work both smart and\\nhard. \\xa0The biggest prizes are heavily competed for.\\xa0 This isn’t true in every field (there are\\ngreat mathematicians who never spend that many hours a week working) but it is\\nin most. \\ufeffPrioritization My system has\\nthree key pillars: “Make sure to get the important shit done”, “Don’t waste\\ntime on stupid shit”, and “make a lot of lists”. I highly\\nrecommend using lists. \\xa0I make lists of what I want to accomplish each\\nyear, each month, and each day. \\xa0Lists are very focusing, and they help me\\nwith multitasking because I don’t have to keep as much in my head.\\xa0 If I’m not in the mood for some particular\\ntask, I can always find something else I’m excited to do. I prefer lists\\nwritten down on paper.\\xa0 It’s easy to add\\nand remove tasks.\\xa0 I can access them\\nduring meetings without feeling rude.\\xa0 I\\nre-transcribe lists frequently, which forces me to think about everything on the\\nlist and gives me an opportunity to add and remove items. I don’t bother\\nwith categorization or trying to size tasks or anything like that (the most I\\ndo is put a star next to really important items). I try to\\nprioritize in a way that generates momentum. \\xa0The more I get done, the\\nbetter I feel, and then the more I get done.\\xa0\\nI like to start and end each day with something I can really make\\nprogress on. I am\\nrelentless about getting my most important projects done—I’ve found that if I\\nreally want something to happen and I push hard enough, it usually happens. I try to be\\nruthless about saying no to stuff, and doing non-critical things in the\\nquickest way possible. \\xa0I probably take this too far—for example, I am\\nalmost sure I am terse to the point of rudeness when replying to emails. I generally\\ntry to avoid meetings and conferences as I find the time cost to be huge—I get\\nthe most value out of time in my office. \\xa0However, it is critical that you\\nkeep enough space in your schedule to allow for chance encounters and exposure\\nto new people and ideas. \\xa0Having an open network is valuable; though\\nprobably 90% of the random meetings I take are a waste of time, the other 10%\\nreally make up for it. I find most meetings are best scheduled for 15-20 minutes, or 2 hours. \\xa0The default of 1 hour is usually wrong, and leads to a lot of wasted time. I have\\ndifferent times of day I try to use for different kinds of work. \\xa0The\\nfirst few hours of the morning are definitely my most productive time of the\\nday, so I don’t let anyone schedule anything then. \\xa0I try to do meetings\\nin the afternoon.\\xa0 I take a break, or\\nswitch tasks, whenever I feel my attention starting to fade. I don’t think\\nmost people value their time enough—I am surprised by the number of people I\\nknow who make $100 an hour and yet will spend a couple of hours doing something\\nthey don’t want to do to save $20. Also, don’t\\nfall into the trap of productivity porn—chasing productivity for its own sake\\nisn’t helpful. \\xa0Many people spend too much time thinking about how to perfectly\\noptimize their system, and not nearly enough asking if they’re working on the\\nright problems. \\xa0It doesn’t matter what system you use or if you squeeze\\nout every second if you’re working on the wrong thing. The right goal\\nis to allocate your year optimally, not your day. Physical factors Very likely\\nwhat is optimal for me won’t be optimal for you. \\xa0You’ll have to\\nexperiment to find out what works best for your body.\\xa0 It’s definitely worth doing—it helps in all\\naspects of life, and you’ll feel a lot better and happier overall. It probably\\ntook a little bit of my time every week for a few years to arrive at what works\\nbest for me, but my sense is if I do a good job at all the below I’m at least\\n1.5x more productive than if not. Sleep seems to\\nbe the most important physical factor in productivity for me. \\xa0Some sort\\nof sleep tracker to figure out how to sleep best is helpful. \\xa0I’ve found the only\\nthing I’m consistent with are in the set-it-and-forget-it category, and I\\nreally like the Emfit QS+Active . I like a cold,\\ndark, quiet room, and a great mattress (I resisted spending a bunch of money on\\na great mattress for years, which was stupid—it makes a huge difference to my\\nsleep quality. \\xa0I love this one ). \\xa0Not eating a lot in the few hours before sleep\\nhelps.\\xa0 Not drinking alcohol helps a lot, though\\nI’m not willing to do that all the time. I use a Chili\\nPad to be cold while I sleep if I can’t get the room cold enough, which is\\ngreat but loud (I set it up to have the cooler unit outside my room). When traveling,\\nI use an eye mask and ear plugs . This is likely\\nto be controversial, but I take a low dose of sleeping pills (like a third of a\\nnormal dose) or a very low dose of cannabis whenever I can’t sleep. \\xa0I am\\na bad sleeper in general, and a particularly bad sleeper when I travel.\\xa0 It likely has tradeoffs,\\nbut so does not sleeping well.\\xa0 If you\\ncan already sleep well, I wouldn’t recommend this. I use a full\\nspectrum LED light most mornings for about 10-15 minutes while I catch up on\\nemail. \\xa0It’s great—if you try nothing else in here, this is the thing I’d\\ntry.\\xa0 It’s a ridiculous gain for me.\\n\\xa0I like this one , and it’s easy to travel with. Exercise is\\nprobably the second most important physical factor. \\xa0I tried a number of\\ndifferent exercise programs for a few months each and the one that seemed best\\nwas lifting heavy weights 3x a week for an hour, and high intensity interval\\ntraining occasionally. \\xa0In addition to productivity gains, this is also\\nthe exercise program that makes me feel the best overall. The third area\\nis nutrition. \\xa0I very rarely eat breakfast, so I get about 15 hours of\\nfasting most days (except an espresso when I wake up). \\xa0I know this is contrary\\nto most advice, and I suspect it’s not optimal for most people, but it\\ndefinitely works well for me. Eating lots of\\nsugar is the thing that makes me feel the worst and that I try hardest to\\navoid. \\xa0I also try to avoid foods that aggravate my digestion or spike up\\ninflammation (for example, very spicy foods). \\xa0I don’t have much willpower when it comes to\\nsweet things, so I mostly just try to keep junk food out of the house. I have one big shot of espresso immediately when I wake up and one after lunch. \\xa0I assume this is\\nabout 200mg total of caffeine per day.\\xa0 I\\ntried a few other configurations; this was the one that worked by far the best.\\n\\xa0I otherwise aggressively avoid stimulants, but I will have more coffee if\\nI’m super tired and really need to get something done. I’m\\nvegetarian and have been since I was a kid, and I supplement methyl B-12, Omega-3, Iron, and Vitamin D-3. \\xa0I\\ngot to this list with a year or so of quarterly blood tests; it’s worked for me\\never since (I re-test maybe every year and a half or so). \\xa0There are many\\ndoctors who will happily work with you on a super comprehensive blood test (and\\nservices like WellnessFX ).\\xa0 I also go out\\nof my way to drink a lot of protein shakes, which I hate and I wouldn’t do if I\\nweren’t vegetarian. \\ufeffOther stuff Here’s what I\\nlike in a workspace: natural light, quiet, knowing that I won’t be interrupted\\nif I don’t want to be, long blocks of time, and being comfortable and relaxed\\n(I’ve got a beautiful desk with a couple of 4k monitors on it in my office, but\\nI spend almost all my time on my couch with my laptop). I wrote custom\\nsoftware for the annoying things I have to do frequently, which is great.\\n\\xa0I also made an effort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard\\nshortcuts that help with my workflow. Like most\\npeople, I sometimes go through periods of a week or two where I just have no\\nmotivation to do anything (I suspect it may have something to do with\\nnutrition). \\xa0This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient\\ntimes.\\xa0 I have not figured out what to do\\nabout it besides wait for the fog to lift, and to trust that eventually it\\nalways does.\\xa0 And I generally try to\\navoid people and situations that put me in bad moods, which is good advice\\nwhether you care about productivity or not. In general, I\\nthink it’s good to overcommit a little bit. \\xa0I find that I generally get\\ndone what I take on, and if I have a little bit too much to do it makes me more\\nefficient at everything, which is a way to train to avoid distractions (a great\\nhabit to build!). \\xa0However, overcommitting a lot is disastrous. Don’t neglect\\nyour family and friends for the sake of productivity—that’s a very stupid\\ntradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because you’ll be less\\nhappy). \\xa0Don’t neglect doing things you love or that clear your head\\neither. Finally, to\\nrepeat one more time: productivity in the wrong direction isn’t worth anything\\nat all. \\xa0Think more about what to work on. Up vote Up voted 1772 Like this post?
